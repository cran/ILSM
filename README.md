ILSM is designed to analyze interconnection structures, including
interconnection patterns, centrality, and motifs in tripartite
interaction networks.

## Installation

You can install the development version of *ILSM* from GitHub:

``` r
devtools::install_github("WeichengSun/ILSM")
```

## A common tripartite interaction network in this package

For clarification, in the following context we refer to a tripartite
network as a two-subnetwork interaction network (Fig. 1a). It is
composed of three sets of nodes (a-nodes, b-nodes, and c-nodes) and two
subnetworks: the P subnetwork, which contains links between a-nodes and
b-nodes, and the Q subnetwork, which contains links between b-nodes and
c-nodes. The b-nodes serve as the shared set of nodes. Connector nodes
are defined as the common nodes of both subnetworks within the b-nodes
(Fig. 1a). No intra-guild interactions are considered unless specified.

Fig.1. The visualization of an example tripartite interaction network
(a, with three groups of species and two interaction subnetworks) and
interconnection structures for connector species (b-c, two macro-scale
interconnection patterns; d, meso-scale interconnection motif; e,
micro-scale interconnection centrality). In panel a, the connector
species have links from both subnetworks.

<br>We provide examples to showcase the functionality of the *ILSM*
package. First, a worked example demonstrates how to calculate
interconnection patterns, motifs, and centralities (Fig. 1b-c). Second,
extensional functions are shown, including null models and several extra
interconnection structures for tripartite networks with intra-guild
interactions.

## A worked example of analyzing interconnection structures

As a worked example, we use a published pollinator–plant–herbivore (PPH)
binary tripartite network (Villa-Galaviz et al. 2021). This PPH network
(**PPH_Coltparkmeadow**) is a subset of a large hybrid network that
includes plants, flower visitors, leaf miners, and parasitoids from a
long-term nutrient manipulation experiment (Colt Park Meadows) located
at 300 m elevation in Ingleborough National Nature Reserve, Yorkshire
Dales, northern England (54°12′N, 2°21′W). It contains pollinators,
plants, and herbivores, corresponding to mutualistic interactions in the
pollinator–plant subnetwork and antagonistic interactions in the
plant–herbivore subnetwork. Plants are the shared set of species between
the two subnetworks. We also generate random weights to illustrate the
analysis of interconnection structures in weighted or quantitative
tripartite networks.

### Interconnection pattern

Interconnection pattern refers to a macro-scale property describing how
connector nodes (species) interconnect two subnetworks. Five
interconnection patterns are supported: proportion of connector nodes
(**poc**), correlation of interaction degree (**coid**), correlation of
interaction similarity (**cois**), participation coefficient (**pc**),
and proportion of connector nodes in shared node hubs (**hc**).

``` r
library(ILSM);library(igraph)
#Load the 'igraph' data 
data(PPH_Coltparkmeadow)
#Or read two matrices and transform them to an 'igraph'. .
P_mat<-as.matrix(read.csv("./data/PP.csv",row.names = 1,check.names=FALSE))
Q_mat<-as.matrix(read.csv("./data/HP.csv",row.names = 1,check.names=FALSE))
PPH_Coltparkmeadow<-trigraph_from_mat(P_mat,Q_mat,weighted = F)

#Generating random weights to showcase weighted metrics
E(PPH_Coltparkmeadow)$weight<-runif(length(E(PPH_Coltparkmeadow)),0.1,1.5) 

#proportion of connector nodes
poc(PPH_Coltparkmeadow)
poc(P_mat,Q_mat)
#correlation of interaction degree 
coid(PPH_Coltparkmeadow)
coid(PPH_Coltparkmeadow,weighted=T)
#correlation of interaction similarity
cois(PPH_Coltparkmeadow)
cois(PPH_Coltparkmeadow,weighted=T)
#participation coefficient 
pc(PPH_Coltparkmeadow)
pc(PPH_Coltparkmeadow,weighted=T)
#proportion of connector nodes in shared node hubs
hc(PPH_Coltparkmeadow)
hc(PPH_Coltparkmeadow,weighted=T)
```

### Interconnection motif

Here, we define 48 forms of interconnection motifs (Fig. 2). An
interconnection motif must comprise three sets of connected nodes: the
connector nodes (belonging to the b-nodes), the nodes in one subnetwork
(belonging to the a-nodes in the P subnetwork), and the nodes in the
other subnetwork (belonging to the c-nodes in the Q subnetwork). We
further restrict each motif to contain no more than six nodes and to
have no intra-guild interactions.

The 48 interconnection motifs are provided as *igraph* objects through
the **Multi_motif** function in this package.

``` r
library(ILSM)
motif_names<-c("M111","M112","M113","M114","M211","M212","M213","M311","M312","M411","M121","M122-1",
       "M122-2","M122-3","M123-1","M123-2","M123-3","M123-4","M123-5","M221-1","M221-2",
       "M221-3","M222-1","M222-2","M222-3","M222-4","M222-5","M222-6","M222-7","M222-8",
       "M222-9","M321-1","M321-2","M321-3","M321-4","M321-5","M131","M132-1","M132-2",
       "M132-3","M132-4","M132-5","M231-1","M231-2","M231-3","M231-4","M231-5","M141")
mr <- par(mfrow=c(6,8),mar=c(1,1,3,1))
IM_res<-Multi_motif("all")
 for(i in 1:48){
     plot(IM_res[[i]],
          vertex.size=30, vertex.label=NA,
          vertex.color="#D0E7ED",main=motif_names[i])
}
par(mr)
```

The 48 interconnection motifs are named “MABC-i”: M means “motif’,”A” is
the number of a-nodes, “B” is the number of b-nodes, “C” is the number
of c-nodes and “i” is the serial number for the motifs with the same
“ABC”. The interconnection motifs are ordered by the number of connector
nodes (from 1 to 4). The numbers from 1 to 70 in connector nodes
represent the unique roles defined by motifs.

Fig. 2. The 48 forms of interconnection motifs with 3-6 nodes and no
intra-guild interactions. Blue and grey nodes from one subnetwork, and
grey and orange nodes from the other subnetwork. Grey nodes are
connector nodes.

<br>For a tripartite network, the **icmotif_count** function returns the
counts of each motif, while **icmotif_role** provides the counts of
motif roles.

``` r
icmotif_count(PPH_Coltparkmeadow)
icmotif_role(PPH_Coltparkmeadow)
icmotif_count(PPH_Coltparkmeadow, weighted=T)
icmotif_role(PPH_Coltparkmeadow, weighted=T)
```

### Interconnection centrality

Interconnection centrality measures the importance of connector nodes in
linking two subnetworks within a tripartite network. This differs from
standard centrality measures (e.g., those in *igraph*), which treat
connector nodes the same as other nodes. The **node_icc** provides three
interconnection centrality metrics. For binary networks, interconnection
degree centrality for each connector species is defined as the product
of its degree values from the two subnetworks. Interconnection
betweenness centrality is calculated as the number of shortest paths
between a-nodes and c-nodes that pass through the connector species.
Interconnection closeness centrality is defined as the inverse of the
sum of distances from the connector species to both a-nodes and c-nodes.
For weighted networks, interaction strengths are incorporated into the
calculations of weighted degree, shortest paths, and distances.

``` r
node_icc(PPH_Coltparkmeadow)
node_icc(PPH_Coltparkmeadow,weighted=T)
```

## Extensional analysis

### Null models

Null models are commonly used to test the non-randomness of topology in
ecological networks. The **tri_null** provides two types of null models.
The first type shuffles shared nodes following Sauve et al. (2016)
without altering the subnetwork structures. The second type shuffles
links in one or both subnetworks or layers using algorithms from the R
package *vegan* (version 2.6-4), applied independently to one or both
subnetworks.

``` r
#Testing the significance of CoID, CoIS and interconnection motifs against null models 
library(ggplot2);library(pbapply)
set.seed(12)
coid_obs<-coid(PPH_Coltparkmeadow)
cois_obs<-cois(PPH_Coltparkmeadow)
null_net<-vector("list",100)
 i<-1
   while (i<=100) {
      tmp<-tri_null(PPH_Coltparkmeadow,1, null_type = "both_sub",sub_method="r00")[[1]]# try "sauve"
      if(poc(tmp)[2]>=4){# ensuring the simulated networks have at least four connector nodes. This is up to the structure to test. E.g., two few connector nodes led to NA for CoID. 
         null_net[[i]]<-tmp;
         i<-i+1
      }}
   coid_null<-pbsapply(null_net,coid)
   cois_null<-pbsapply(null_net,cois)
   icmotif_null<-pbsapply(null_net,function(x){icmotif_count(x)[,2]})# Counts of motifs for null models
   # function to calculate the Z value and P value.
   null_zp<-function(original_value,nullvalues){
      z=(original_value-mean(nullvalues,na.rm=T))/sd(nullvalues,na.rm=T)
      pless <- sum(original_value >= nullvalues, na.rm = TRUE)
      pmore <- sum(original_value <= nullvalues, na.rm = TRUE)
      p<-2 * pmin(pless, pmore)
      p=pmin(1, (p + 1)/(length(nullvalues) + 1))
      c(z=z,p=p)
   }
   # Z and P values
   null_zp(coid_obs,coid_null)# for coid
   null_zp(cois_obs,cois_null)# for cois
   icmotif_null_and_obs<-cbind(icmotif_count(PPH_Coltparkmeadow)[,2],icmotif_null)
   apply( icmotif_null_and_obs,1,function(x){null_zp(x[1],x[-1])})# for motifs
```

### For tripartite networks with intra-guild interactions

#### Interconnection motifs with intra-guild interactions

Although most empirical tripartite interaction networks currently lack
intra-guild interactions, these interactions are increasingly studied
(Garcia-Callejas et al. 2023) and play a crucial role in community
dynamics. Therefore, we also defined interconnection motif forms that
include intra-guild interactions to support potential meso-scale
analyses in tripartite networks. Because incorporating intra-guild links
greatly increases the number of possible motif forms, we restricted each
guild to contain only two nodes, resulting in 107 interconnection
motifs. Detailed algorithms:
[ig_icmotif_count_algorithm](https://github.com/WeichengSun/ILSM/blob/main/data/ig_icmotif_count_algorithm.pdf),
[ig_icmotif_role_algorithm](https://github.com/WeichengSun/ILSM/blob/main/data/ig_icmotif_role_algorithm.pdf).

Fig. 4. The 107 forms of interconnection motifs with intra-guild
interactions. Each guild contains only two nodes at most. Blue and grey
nodes from one subnetwork, and grey and orange nodes from the other
subnetwork. Grey nodes are connector nodes.

For a tripartite network with intra-guild interactions,
**ig_icmotif_count** returns the counts of each motif, while
**ig_icmotif_role** returns the counts of motif roles. Currently,
ig_icmotif_role supports role counts only for the 43 roles in the first
35 motifs.

```

#### Species-level intra-guild and inter-guild interaction overlap

The **ig_overlap_guild** calculates species-level intra-guild and
inter_guild interaction overlap for a tripartite network with
intra-guild interactions (Garcia-Callejas et al. 2023).

``` r
ig_overlap_guild(toy_mat,guilds=myguilds)
```
